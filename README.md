# The Leaf Impact: Exploring the Relationship Between Bike Usage and Urban Trees in NYC
Duru Irmak Unsal

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between Citi Bike usage and the presence of trees across New York City. Citi Bike, the largest bike-sharing program in the United States, offers data on bike trips and station locations, while the NYC Street Tree Census dataset provides detailed information on the city's trees, including their species, health, and location. The primary goal of this analysis is to investigate how the presence and condition of trees near Citi Bike stations influence bike usage patterns.

## Questions:

**Could CitiBike increase bike usage through the optimization of nearby tree greenery?**

1. Are bike stations located in areas with higher tree density used more frequently compared to stations in less green areas?
2. Does the health of nearby trees have any influence on bike usage at specific stations?
3. How do seasonal changes in tree conditions (e.g., foliage in summer vs. bare trees in winter) affect bike usage trends?
4. Do different user types prefer stations with more greenery?

By examining these relationships, this project attempts to uncover how urban greenery impacts transportation habits in New York -- potentially providing insights for future urban planning.
